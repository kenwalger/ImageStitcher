##Image Stitcher

Select images to stitch in left to right order.

To install

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

OpenCV 3.1.0 has more installation requirements than just:
```pip install opencv-python```

Depending on your operating system and Python version additional 
installation steps _may_ be required.

To use

```python stitch.py --first <left-image> --second <right-image>```
